Credit_Risk_Analysis

## Project Overview

For this project we are utilizing several models of **supervised machine learning** on credit loan data in order to predict credit risk. Credit risk is an inherently unbalanced classification problem, as good loans easily outnumber risky loans. We will be using Python, **imbalanced-learn, Scikit-learn libraries** and several machine learning models to compare the strengths and weaknesses of **ML models** and determine how well a model classifies and predicts data. 

## Purpose

The purpose of this analysis is to create a supervised machine learning model that could accurately predict credit risk. In order to complete this task, we used 6 different methods:
- Naive Random Oversampling
- SMOTE Oversampling
- Cluster Centroid Undersampling
- SMOTEENN Sampling
- Balanced Random Forest Classifying
- Easy Ensemble Classifying
Through each of these methods, we need to split the data into training and testing datasets, and compiled accuracy scores, confusion matrices, and classification reports as per results.


## Requirements

- Use Resampling Models to Predict Credit Risk
- Use the SMOTEENN algorithm to Predict Credit Risk
- Use Ensemble Classifiers to Predict Credit Risk
- A Written Report on the Credit Risk Analysis

## Resources
- Data Source: LoanStats_2019Q1.csv (file itâ€™s not uploaded to GitHub because of its size)
- Software: **Jupyter Notebook**
- Languages: **Python**
- Libraries: **Scikit-learn** , **imbalanced-learn**
- Environment: **Python 3.7**

## Results

In this analysis we used six different algorithms of **supervised machine learning**.
  - First four algorithms are based on **resampling techniques** and are designed to deal with **class imbalance**. 
  - After the data is resampled, Logistic Regression is used to predict the outcome. 
    - Logistic regression predicts **binary outcomes** .
  - The last two models are from ensemble learning group.
    - The concept of ensemble learning is the process of combining multiple models, 
    - Like decision tree algorithms, to help improve the accuracy and robustness, as well as decrease variance of the model,
    - therefore increase the overall performance of the model .

### 1. Naive Random Oversampling and Logistic Regression
In random oversampling, instances of the minority class are randomly selected and added to the training set until the majority and minority classes are balanced. 

- **Accuracy score:** 0.65
- **Precision**
    - For high risk: 0.01
    - For low risk: 1.00
- **Recall**
    - For high risk: 0.71
    - For low risk: 0.60
