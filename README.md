# Credit_Risk_Analysis
Credit_Risk_Analysis

## Project Overview

For this project we are utilizing several models of **supervised machine learning** on credit loan data in order to predict credit risk. Credit risk is an inherently unbalanced classification problem, as good loans easily outnumber risky loans. We will be using Python, **imbalanced-learn, Scikit-learn libraries** and several machine learning models to compare the strengths and weaknesses of **ML models** and determine how well a model classifies and predicts data. 

## Purpose

The purpose of this analysis is to create a supervised machine learning model that could accurately predict credit risk. In order to complete this task, we used 6 different methods:
- Naive Random Oversampling
- SMOTE Oversampling
- Cluster Centroid Undersampling
- SMOTEENN Sampling
- Balanced Random Forest Classifying
- Easy Ensemble Classifying
Through each of these methods, we need to split the data into training and testing datasets, and compiled accuracy scores, confusion matrices, and classification reports as per results.


## Requirements

- Use Resampling Models to Predict Credit Risk
- Use the SMOTEENN algorithm to Predict Credit Risk
- Use Ensemble Classifiers to Predict Credit Risk
- A Written Report on the Credit Risk Analysis
