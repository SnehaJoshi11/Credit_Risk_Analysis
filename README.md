# Credit_Risk_Analysis
Credit_Risk_Analysis

## Project Overview
For this project we are utilizing several models of **supervised machine learning** on credit loan data in order to predict credit risk. Credit risk is an inherently unbalanced classification problem, as good loans easily outnumber risky loans. I will be using Python and **Scikit-learn libraries** and several machine learning models to compare the strengths and weaknesses of **ML models** and determine how well a model classifies and predicts data. 

## Purpose
The purpose of this analysis was to create a supervised machine learning model that could accurately predict credit risk. In order to complete this task, I used 6 different methods, which are:

## Requirements

- Naive Random Oversampling
- SMOTE Oversampling
- Cluster Centroid Undersampling
- SMOTEENN Sampling
- Balanced Random Forest Classifying
- Easy Ensemble Classifying
- Through each of these methods, I split my data into training and testing datasets, and compiled accuracy scores, confusion matries, and classification reports as my results.
